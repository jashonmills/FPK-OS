## Educator Logging

### When to Log

Create an **Educator Log** after:
- Individual therapy sessions (speech, OT, PT, counseling)
- ABA sessions
- Special education instruction
- Social skills groups
- Academic support sessions
- In-class observations
- School day summaries

### The Educator Log Form

Navigate to **Activity Log** → **Add Log** → **Educator Log**

#### Session Information

**Session Type** (select one):
- Academic Instruction
- Speech Therapy
- Occupational Therapy (OT)
- Physical Therapy (PT)
- Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)
- Social Skills Training
- Counseling/Mental Health
- Other

**Duration**: Length of session (e.g., 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour)

**Date/Time**: When the session occurred

#### Focus Areas

**What We Worked On**: Free-text description of session content

Examples:
- "Practiced /r/ sound in initial position of words"
- "Worked on letter recognition A-F, counting 1-10"
- "Bilateral coordination activities - jumping jacks, catching bean bags"
- "Turn-taking during board game, requesting help appropriately"

#### Prompting Level

Document the level of support needed for task success:

- **Independent**: Completed with no prompts
- **Verbal Prompt**: Needed spoken cues ("What's next?")
- **Gestural Prompt**: Needed pointing or gestures
- **Visual Prompt**: Needed visual schedule, written steps, or modeling
- **Partial Physical**: Light physical guidance (hand-over-hand start)
- **Full Physical**: Full hand-over-hand assistance

**Why This Matters**: Tracking prompting over time shows progress toward independence - a key IEP goal for many students.

#### Academic Performance (if applicable)

If you worked on academic skills, document:

**Skill Area**:
- Reading (decoding, comprehension, fluency)
- Writing (handwriting, composition, spelling)
- Math (computation, problem-solving, number sense)
- Other academic areas

**Fluency Level**:
- **Acquisition**: Learning the skill, high error rate
- **Fluency Building**: Knows the skill, working on speed and accuracy
- **Maintenance**: Skill is solid, practicing to retain
- **Generalization**: Applying skill in new contexts

**Accuracy**: Percentage correct (e.g., "8/10 correct = 80%")

**Trial Data**: Attach or describe specific trial-by-trial data if relevant

#### Social & Behavioral Observations

**Social Participation**:
- Did the student engage with peers?
- Quality of interactions (parallel play, cooperative play, conversation)
- Any social challenges or successes?

**Attention & Engagement**:
- How long could they sustain attention?
- Level of interest in activities
- Response to redirection

**Behavior During Session**:
- Overall cooperation
- Any challenging behaviors (specify type, frequency, intensity)
- Mood and affect

#### Linking to IEP Goals

**Goals Addressed**: Select from the student's active goals

Benefits:
- Automatically updates goal progress charts
- Shows service delivery compliance
- Helps families see how therapy connects to IEP

#### Recommendations & Carryover

**Homework/Practice Activities**:
- What should be practiced at home?
- Specific activities for parents/caregivers
- Materials or resources needed

**Notes for Next Session**:
- What to continue
- What to modify
- Data to review

#### Attachments

Upload:
- Session data sheets
- Work samples
- Photos of activities
- Visual supports used

## Other Log Types

While **Educator Logs** are your primary tool, you can also create:

### Incident Logs

If you observe a behavioral incident during your session:

1. Navigate to **Activity Log** → **Add Log** → **Incident Log**
2. Document:
   - **Incident Type**: Aggression, self-injury, property destruction, refusal, meltdown, sensory overload, elopement
   - **Severity**: 1-10 scale
   - **ABC Data**:
     - **Antecedent**: What was happening right before? (demand, transition, sensory trigger, peer interaction, etc.)
     - **Behavior**: Detailed, objective description
     - **Consequence**: What happened after? How was it managed?
   - **Function**: Your professional assessment (escape, attention, sensory, tangible, communication)
   - **Intervention Used**: Strategy you implemented
   - **Effectiveness**: Did it work?

**Why This Is Valuable**: Your functional behavior analysis helps the team understand patterns and refine the BIP.

### Parent Logs

If you're a home-based provider or caregiver, you can use **Parent Logs** to document:
- Daily mood and energy
- Activities and routines
- Social interactions
- Meals and sleep

### Sleep Logs

For sleep consultants or behavioral sleep programs, document:
- Bedtime and wake time
- Sleep quality
- Nighttime wakings
- Pre-sleep routines
- Sleep environment

## Viewing Analytics & Progress

### Accessing Charts

Navigate to **Analytics** to view:

1. **Activity Log Chart**: See the density of logging across the team
2. **IEP Goal & Service Tracker**: Verify service minutes and goal progress
3. **Academic Fluency Trends**: Watch skill acquisition over time
4. **Prompting Level Fading**: Visual proof of increasing independence
5. **Social Interaction Funnel**: Track social skill development
6. **Incident Frequency**: Behavior trends (if applicable)
7. **Intervention Effectiveness**: What strategies work best

### Why Analytics Matter for Professionals

- **Progress Monitoring**: Objective data for progress reports
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Identify what's working and what needs adjustment
- **IEP Meeting Prep**: Visual charts to share with the team
- **Parent Communication**: Show families concrete progress
- **Insurance/Funding Justification**: Document medical necessity

### Filtering Data

## Using the AI Assistant

### How the AI Can Help You

The AI Assistant has access to:
- All logs (yours and the family's)
- Uploaded documents (IEPs, evaluations, BIPs)
- Student profile data
- Clinical knowledge base (40+ evidence-based sources)

### Professional Use Cases

**Session Planning**:
- "Based on recent logs, what skills should I prioritize for this student?"
- "What are the student's current IEP goals in the communication domain?"

**Progress Reporting**:
- "Summarize this student's progress in social skills over the past month."
- "What percentage of sessions showed independent performance on X skill?"

**Functional Analysis**:
- "What patterns do you see in the antecedents to meltdowns during therapy?"
- "When does this student show the best engagement and attention?"

**Evidence-Based Strategies**:
- "What does research say about teaching turn-taking to autistic children?"
- "What are evidence-based interventions for selective mutism?"

**Accommodation Review**:
- "What accommodations are listed in this student's IEP?"
- "Are there sensory accommodations we should be implementing?"

### Asking Effective Questions

**Be Specific**:
- ❌ "How is the student doing?"
- ✅ "How has this student's accuracy on CVC word reading changed over the past 6 weeks?"

**Use Time Ranges**:
- "Over the past month..."
- "Since the start of the school year..."
- "In the last 10 sessions..."

**Request Research Support**:
- "What does the research say about..."
- "What are evidence-based practices for..."

**Ask for Comparisons**:
- "Is the student more engaged during structured vs. play-based activities?"
- "Do behaviors increase on days with poor sleep?"

### Protecting Student Privacy

**Important**: Do not copy/paste AI responses directly into external reports or emails without:
1. Removing any identifiable information
2. Paraphrasing in your own professional language
3. Ensuring compliance with HIPAA/FERPA

The AI is a **clinical decision support tool**, not a replacement for your professional judgment or documentation.

## Best Practices for Professionals

### 1. **Log Immediately After Sessions**

Data is most accurate when entered right after the session, not at the end of the week. Use the mobile interface to log from your car or office.

### 2. **Be Objective and Descriptive**

**Instead of**: "Had a bad day"  
**Try**: "Refused 3/5 tasks, required 2 sensory breaks, threw materials once"

Objective data = better pattern analysis.

### 3. **Use Prompting Levels Consistently**

If you track prompting, use the same definitions every time. This ensures the "Prompting Level Fading" chart accurately reflects progress.

### 4. **Link Every Log to Goals**

If you worked on an IEP goal, link it. This:
- Shows service delivery compliance
- Auto-updates goal progress
- Helps justify continued services

### 5. **Communicate Carryover Activities**

Parents appreciate specific, actionable homework. Instead of "practice at home," try:
- "Practice labeling 5 family members in photos, 2x per day"
- "Read 3 CVC words before bedtime using the word cards I sent"

### 6. **Use the AI for Pattern Recognition**

Before writing a progress report, ask the AI:
- "What patterns emerged in this student's performance over the past quarter?"
- "How has their independence changed since September?"

This saves time and ensures you don't miss key insights.

### 7. **Respect Family Privacy**

- Don't screenshot or share platform data outside the family's team
- Don't use student data for research without explicit consent
- Follow HIPAA/FERPA guidelines for all documentation

### 8. **Coordinate with the Team**

Check the Activity Log regularly to see what parents and other providers are observing. This helps you:
- Adjust your approach based on home behaviors
- Reinforce strategies that are working elsewhere
- Identify environmental or contextual factors

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this platform to replace my existing documentation system?

Many therapists and educators use FPX MyCNS-App as their **primary documentation** for private clients or supplemental tracking for school students. However:
- Check your organization's policies
- Ensure the platform meets any regulatory requirements for your setting
- You may still need to duplicate notes into your school/clinic EMR

### Do I need to create a separate account for each family?

No. One account can be linked to **multiple families**. You'll see a family selector at the top of the dashboard if you're a Contributor for more than one family.

### Can I see data from other families?

**No**. The platform uses strict row-level security. You can only access data for families that have explicitly invited you.

### Who pays for my access?

The family owner's subscription includes your access. You do not need to pay separately.

### What if I leave a family's team (change jobs, student transitions, etc.)?

The family owner can remove you from the team at any time. You'll lose access to that family's data, but:
- Your logs remain in the system
- You retain access to other families you support

### Can I invite other team members?

No, only the family owner can send invitations. You can suggest they invite other providers (e.g., co-therapist, classroom aide).

### What happens to my notes if the family cancels their subscription?

The family retains access to all data for 90 days after cancellation. After that, data may be archived. Any critical notes should be saved to your own records if the family plans to cancel.
