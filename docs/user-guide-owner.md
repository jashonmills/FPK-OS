## Tips for Success

### 1. **Log Consistently**
The platform's power comes from data density. Even brief daily parent logs unlock massive value.

### 2. **Use Voice Input**
Logging after a tough incident? Use voice-to-text instead of typing. It's faster and captures details in the moment.

### 3. **Invite Your Team Early**
The more perspectives (educator, therapist, grandparent), the clearer the patterns.

### 4. **Upload All Documents**
Past evaluations, old IEPs, even handwritten notes. The AI can extract insights from everything.

### 5. **Ask the AI for Summaries Before Meetings**
Before an IEP meeting, ask: "Summarize my child's progress and challenges from the past 3 months."

### 6. **Explore Quick Buttons**
Set up shortcuts for common log entries (e.g., "Took melatonin", "Smooth bedtime routine") to save time.

### 7. **Review Analytics Weekly**
Spend 5 minutes each Sunday reviewing the charts. You'll spot patterns you'd never see day-to-day.

### 8. **Trust the ABC Data**
The more detailed your ABC logs, the faster you'll identify function and effective interventions.
