# Student Self-Assessment Checklists and Quizzes

These self-assessment tools are designed to help neurodiverse learners gain deeper insight into their learning preferences, executive functioning strengths and challenges, and comprehension of course material. They are intended for personal reflection and to guide the selection and application of personalized learning strategies.

## 1. Learning Style Inventory

This inventory helps you identify your dominant learning preferences. There are no right or wrong answers; the goal is to understand how you best absorb and process information.

```markdown
### My Learning Style Inventory

**Instructions:** Read each statement and rate how much it applies to you on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 = Rarely/Never and 5 = Always/Strongly Applies.

**Visual Learner Traits:**
1.  I understand information best when I see it (e.g., diagrams, charts, videos). (1-5)
2.  I prefer to read instructions rather than hear them. (1-5)
3.  I use color-coding in my notes or study materials. (1-5)
4.  I remember faces more easily than names. (1-5)
5.  I often use gestures when I speak. (1-5)

**Auditory Learner Traits:**
1.  I understand information best when I hear it (e.g., lectures, discussions, podcasts). (1-5)
2.  I prefer to listen to instructions rather than read them. (1-5)
3.  I often talk to myself or read aloud to understand concepts. (1-5)
4.  I remember names more easily than faces. (1-5)
5.  I enjoy group discussions and debates. (1-5)

**Kinesthetic/Tactile Learner Traits:**
1.  I understand information best when I do it (e.g., hands-on activities, experiments, role-playing). (1-5)
2.  I learn best by practicing or trying things out. (1-5)
3.  I find it hard to sit still for long periods and prefer to move around. (1-5)
4.  I use physical objects or models to understand concepts. (1-5)
5.  I often use hand movements or fidget when I think. (1-5)

**Reflection:**
*   Which category had the highest scores? What does this tell you about your preferred learning style?
*   How can you incorporate more of your preferred learning style into your study routine?
*   Are there any areas where you scored low that you might want to develop?
