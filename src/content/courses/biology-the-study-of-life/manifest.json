To create a clear definition, biologists have identified seven key characteristics that are shared by nearly all forms of life. These are not just a checklist, but interconnected properties that define the dynamic nature of living systems. Understanding these characteristics is the first step to understanding all other biological concepts."

These molecules build organelles, which are the functional components of cells. Cells are the basic unit of life. In many organisms, cells form tissues, tissues form organs, and organs work together in organ systems.\n\n**2. Metabolism:** Living things must use energy and consume nutrients to carry out their life processes. Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions that occur within an organism, including converting food into energy (like in cellular respiration) and using that energy to build or repair cells.\n\n**3. Homeostasis:** This is the ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment. For example, your body maintains a constant temperature of around 37°C (98.6°F) whether it's hot or cold outside, through mechanisms like sweating or shivering.\n\n**4. Growth and Development:** Living organisms grow and develop according to a genetic program. This isn't just about getting bigger; it involves cell division and differentiation, where cells become specialized to perform different functions.\n\n**5. Response to Stimuli:** All life reacts to changes in its environment. A plant turning towards the sun, a bacterium moving away from a toxic chemical, or you pulling your hand away from a hot stove are all examples of responding to stimuli.\n\n**6. Reproduction:** Living things can produce new individuals, passing their genetic material (DNA) to their offspring. This can be asexual (one parent) or sexual (two parents).\n\n**7. Adaptation and Evolution:** Over generations, populations of organisms evolve and become better adapted to their environment. This process of natural selection is the driving force behind the incredible diversity of life on Earth.",
