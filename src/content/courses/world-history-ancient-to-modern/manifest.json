Around 10,000 BCE, a monumental shift occurred: the Neolithic Revolution. Humans began to domesticate plants and animals, transitioning from a nomadic lifestyle to settled agriculture. This was arguably the single most important event in human history, as it allowed for permanent settlements, food surpluses, and population growth, which in turn paved the way for everything that followed: cities, governments, writing, and complex societies."
