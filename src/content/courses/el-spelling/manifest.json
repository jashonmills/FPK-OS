Is there any waggy ears? Tail? Tail? That's not a tail. Tongue hanging out? The waggy tail? If anything is moving, get them to pause it.

They might go yes, they might go no, leave it for as long as they want, and when they say yes, you take it down, ask them the colour of the letters, get them to spell the word, then ask them to change the colour of the letters and spell it in reverse.

Some days, okay, we say practice for five minutes a day for 28 days. But some days you might only get five words. Some days you might only get two words. That's okay.
