If you hypothesise that 'fairies make plants grow faster,' there's no way to test or disprove that. A falsifiable hypothesis, like 'plants grow faster with more sunlight,' can be tested with an experiment. The best hypotheses are specific and measurable."

This symbiotic relationship allowed both the host cell and the mitochondria to survive and thrive, a major event in the evolution of complex life."
