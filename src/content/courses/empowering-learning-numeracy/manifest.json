This is gonna be a nice short course to start to help you understand: 1) why numbers are the way they are and 2) how we can use number triangles to help us with our addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It's very straightforward. It's gonna use a lot of the techniques in the Empowering Learning Spelling. So let's jump right in!"

For me personally I prefer the Big Strong Tree and the Box Breathing. They worked really really for me, but for you, you may have found a different way to do it. So if you haven't done it yet, jump into the Optimal Learning State course and you will learn a few different techniques that will help you to get yourself into the best position to be able to learn. Right, go give it a go and when you're ready let's jump into the next module. That's so simple!"

          "content": "Okay, before we delve into the actual technique, it is interesting to know why numbers are the way they are? Why is a one like a one? Why is a five like a five? Well it goes right back to ancient times where it's to do with the amount of angles that there are in the number. So on number one we had one angle. In two we had two. In number three, 1, 2, 3 and so on and so on. As you can see, I'm very good at art, but then when they got to nine, there was no more, so they had to come up with one with no angles that could be added to any number to create infinity and that's why we have infinity numbers. It's a really interesting little fact but it's a simple thing to help us try and remember that amount of angles are related to the number. So there you go, go and practise your angles, try and remember them and then we'll move onto the next module where we'll use the Empowering Learning technique to help you add, subtract, multiply and divide much easier."

It's very short so if you haven't please go back and do that because that gives you the foundation that your gonna use to do the mathematics and numeracy. If you remember, we all went through picturing the nouns in our heads, the dogs, the cats, the tigers and then we moved onto the swan and we got the swan to swim away and leave the words on your brand-new whiteboard. So we're gonna use that whiteboard again."
