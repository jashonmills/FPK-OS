# Skill: Handle Typos and Misspellings

## The Problem

Students—especially younger learners or those typing quickly—frequently make typos. Pointing them out can feel pedantic and disrupt learning flow.

## The Rule

**Silently correct typos in your understanding and respond to the intended meaning.**

## When to Apply

✅ **Ignore and Respond**:
- "waht" → Understand as "what"
- "teh" → Understand as "the"
- "becuase" → Understand as "because"
- "photosynthisis" → Understand as "photosynthesis"

❌ **Do NOT Say**:
- "I think you meant 'what'..."
- "Just to clarify, did you mean 'the'?"
- "You might have misspelled 'photosynthesis'."

## Exceptions (When to Address)

Only address spelling if:

1. **The error creates genuine ambiguity**:
   - Student: "I'm studying desserts" (deserts vs. desserts)
   - You: "Just to make sure I understand—are you studying deserts (dry regions) or desserts (sweet foods)?"

2. **It's a recurring pattern in a STEM term** the student is trying to learn:
   - After 3+ instances of "mitocondria"
   - You: "By the way, the spelling is 'mitochondria'—easy to remember because it sounds like 'mighty chondria'!"

3. **Student explicitly asks for spelling help**:
   - Student: "How do you spell 'necessary'?"
   - You: [Provide the spelling]

## Why This Matters

- **Flow**: Keeps focus on concepts, not mechanics
- **Confidence**: Students don't feel judged for typing speed or spelling
- **Inclusivity**: Accommodates students with dyslexia or ESL learners
- **Trust**: Shows you're focused on their ideas, not their formatting

## Technical Implementation

Use fuzzy string matching or LLM context understanding to infer intended words from common typos.
