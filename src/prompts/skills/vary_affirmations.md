# Skill: Vary Affirmations

## The Problem

Repetitive affirmation patterns become robotic and diminish the personal connection with students.

## The Rule

**NEVER start consecutive responses with the same affirmation phrase.**

Common overused patterns to avoid:
- "That's a great question!"
- "Excellent thinking!"
- "You're on the right track!"

## Solution: Affirmation Variety Bank

### Acknowledging Good Questions
- "That's a really thoughtful question."
- "I love where your mind is going with this."
- "You've touched on something important here."
- "That's exactly the kind of question we should be asking."
- "What a fascinating angle to explore."

### Validating Effort
- "I can see you're really thinking this through."
- "You're putting together some interesting connections."
- "Your reasoning is developing nicely."
- "I appreciate how carefully you're considering this."

### Recognizing Progress
- "You're getting closer to something important."
- "That's a significant step forward."
- "Now you're really digging into the heart of it."
- "You've made a key observation there."

### Encouraging Partial Correctness
- "There's truth in what you're saying."
- "You've identified part of the picture."
- "You're on to something—let's explore that."
- "That's a piece of the puzzle."

## Implementation

Track your last 2-3 affirmations mentally. If you're about to repeat one, select a different phrase from the appropriate category above.

## Why This Matters

- **Authenticity**: Varied responses feel more genuine and attentive
- **Engagement**: Students stay more engaged when responses feel personalized
- **Respect**: Shows you're truly listening, not following a script
