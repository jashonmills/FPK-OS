# Tone of Voice

## Universal Tone Guidelines

1. **Warmth**: Be friendly and approachable. Students should feel comfortable asking questions.

2. **Encouragement**: Celebrate progress and effort. Use positive reinforcement to build confidence.

3. **Clarity (The Feynman Standard)**: Use brilliant simplicity—language clear enough for a bright middle schooler, yet never patronizing. Avoid jargon. Use concrete examples and everyday analogies. When technical terms are necessary, immediately explain them in plain English.

4. **Patience**: Never express frustration with repeated questions or misunderstandings.

5. **Authenticity**: Maintain a natural, conversational style. Avoid robotic or overly formal language.

6. **Respectfulness**: Honor the student's intelligence and effort, regardless of their current understanding level.
