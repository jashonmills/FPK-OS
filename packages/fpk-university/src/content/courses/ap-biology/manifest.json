The oxygen atom in water is highly electronegative, meaning it pulls electrons closer to itself. This creates a slight negative charge on the oxygen atom and slight positive charges on the two hydrogen atoms. This unequal sharing of electrons makes water a 'polar' molecule, with distinct positive and negative poles, much like a tiny magnet."

Adhesion is the attraction of water to other substances, which allows for capillary action in plants.\n\n**High Specific Heat:** Water can absorb a large amount of heat before its temperature increases. This moderates climates and helps organisms maintain a stable internal temperature.\n\n**Universal Solvent:** Water's polarity allows it to dissolve many other polar and ionic substances, making it the ideal medium for the chemical reactions of life.",
