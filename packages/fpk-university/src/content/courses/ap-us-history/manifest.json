The nation was then plunged into two world wars and the worst economic crisis in its history.\n\n### Key Concepts\n*   **The Progressive Era (1890-1920):** Reformers (like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson) sought to use government power to regulate business (trust-busting), protect consumers (e.g., Pure Food and Drug Act), and expand democracy (e.g., women's suffrage via the 19th Amendment).\n*   **Imperialism and World War I:** The U.S. became a world power after the Spanish-American War. It initially remained neutral in WWI but entered in 1917, playing a key role in the Allied victory. The war was followed by a period of isolationism and social tension (the 'Red Scare').\n*   **The Great Depression and the New Deal:** The stock market crash of 1929 triggered a worldwide depression. Franklin D. Roosevelt's 'New Deal' programs dramatically expanded the size and role of the federal government in an effort to provide relief, recovery, and reform (e.g., Social Security, FDIC).\n*   **World War II:** The U.S. entered WWII after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The war effort on the home front ended the Great Depression and led to new opportunities for women and minorities. The war established the U.S. as the world's leading military and economic power and ushered in the atomic age.",

At home, the post-war era saw economic prosperity, the rise of suburbia, and a powerful movement for African American civil rights that challenged the nation to live up to its founding ideals.\n\n### Key Concepts\n*   **The Cold War:** A global struggle against communism, characterized by a nuclear arms race, proxy wars (Korea, Vietnam), and a domestic 'Red Scare' (McCarthyism). The U.S. policy was 'containment,' as articulated in the Truman Doctrine.\n*   **The Civil Rights Movement:** Through non-violent protest (marches, sit-ins) and legal challenges, activists like Martin Luther King Jr. fought to dismantle segregation. Landmark achievements included the Brown v. Board of Education decision (1954), the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n*   **The Great Society and the 1960s:** President Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society' programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) expanded the social safety net. The decade was also marked by the Vietnam War, a youth counter-culture, and other social movements (feminist, environmental, Chicano).\n*   **1970s Stagnation:** The decade was marked by economic problems ('stagflation' - high inflation and high unemployment), an energy crisis, the Watergate scandal which led to Nixon's resignation, and a decline in public trust in government.",

This lesson also focuses on preparing for the AP exam.\n\n### Key Concepts (1980-Present)\n*   **The Reagan Revolution:** The rise of a new conservative movement focused on tax cuts (supply-side economics), deregulation, and a strong national defense to confront the Soviet Union ('peace through strength').\n*   **The End of the Cold War:** The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the U.S. as the world's sole superpower, leading to new foreign policy challenges in the Middle East (Gulf War) and elsewhere.\n*   **The 21st Century:** The era has been defined by the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent War on Terror, the rise of the internet and digital technology, growing concerns about climate change, debates over immigration, and increasing political polarization.\n\n### AP Exam Preparation\n*   **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs):** Focus on analyzing short primary or secondary source stimuli. Practice identifying the source's point of view, purpose, and historical context.\n*   **Short-Answer Questions (SAQs):** Require you to briefly answer a multi-part question, often comparing and contrasting or showing cause and effect. Use the ACE method: Answer the prompt, Cite specific evidence, Explain the connection.\n*   **Document-Based Question (DBQ):** The core of the exam. You must write a cohesive essay that answers a prompt using a set of 7 provided documents, incorporating outside historical knowledge. You must use at least 6 documents and provide context, a thesis, and outside evidence.\n*   **Long Essay Question (LEQ):** You will choose one of three prompts and write an essay using only your own historical knowledge. Focus on developing a clear thesis and supporting it with specific historical evidence.\n\n### Final Project: Practice DBQ\nTo prepare, you will be given a sample DBQ prompt and a set of documents. Your task is to write a full DBQ essay, complete with a thesis statement, contextualization, and analysis of the documents, to be submitted for review.",
