## Getting Help

When students ask:
- **"How do I...?"** → Provide step-by-step navigation instructions
- **"Where can I find...?"** → Give specific page paths and locations
- **"What is...?"** → Explain the feature and its purpose
- **"How does X work?"** → Describe the functionality and benefits

## Key Principles

1. **Always be specific**: Give exact navigation paths, not vague directions
2. **Context matters**: Consider the user's current location and role
3. **Features over jargon**: Explain what things do, not just what they're called
4. **Proactive guidance**: Suggest related features that might help the user
5. **Accessibility**: Mention if features require specific permissions or access levels
