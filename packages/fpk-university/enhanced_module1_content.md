# Module 1: Lines, Angles & Polygons

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 1 of our Geometry course! In this module, we will explore the fundamental concepts of geometry, focusing on lines, angles, and polygons. These concepts form the foundation of geometric understanding and will be essential for all subsequent modules.

> **Teaching Moment:** Geometry is all around us! From the design of buildings to the patterns in nature, geometric principles govern the physical world. As you learn these concepts, try to identify them in your everyday surroundings. This connection between abstract mathematical ideas and real-world applications will deepen your understanding and appreciation of geometry.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Identify and classify different types of lines and angles
- Understand the properties of various polygons
- Apply basic geometric principles to solve problems
- Recognize geometric shapes in real-world contexts
- Develop logical reasoning through geometric proofs

## Section 1: Lines and Line Segments

### What is a Line?

A line is a straight path that extends infinitely in both directions. It has no thickness and is one-dimensional. In geometry, we often represent lines using arrows on both ends to indicate that they extend infinitely.

Key properties of lines:
- A line has no endpoints
- A line is straight (no curves)
- A line has infinite length
- A line has no thickness

> **Teaching Moment:** When we draw a "line" on paper, we're actually drawing a representation of a line, not a true mathematical line. A true line would extend forever in both directions and have no width. This distinction between mathematical abstractions and their physical representations is important throughout geometry.

### Line Segments

A line segment is a portion of a line that has two endpoints. Unlike a line, a line segment has a definite length.

Key properties of line segments:
- A line segment has two endpoints
- A line segment has a measurable length
- A line segment is straight

> **Teaching Moment:** To name a line segment, we use the letters of its endpoints with a line segment symbol above them. For example, a line segment with endpoints A and B is written as $\overline{AB}$. This is different from how we name a line, which would be written as $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.

### Rays

A ray is a portion of a line that has one endpoint and extends infinitely in one direction.

Key properties of rays:
- A ray has one endpoint
- A ray extends infinitely in one direction
- A ray is straight

> **Teaching Moment:** Think of a ray like a beam of light from a flashlight. It starts at a specific point (the flashlight) and continues indefinitely in one direction. We name a ray using its endpoint first, followed by any other point on the ray, with a ray symbol above them. For example, a ray starting at point A and passing through point B is written as $\overrightarrow{AB}$.

### Problem-Solving Approach: Identifying Lines, Line Segments, and Rays

When faced with a problem involving lines, line segments, or rays, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the key elements**: Look for endpoints or lack thereof.
2. **Apply the definitions**: 
   - If it extends infinitely in both directions, it's a line.
   - If it has two endpoints, it's a line segment.
   - If it has one endpoint and extends infinitely in one direction, it's a ray.
3. **Use proper notation**: Label lines, line segments, and rays using the appropriate symbols.

**Example Problem:** 
In the figure below, identify and label all lines, line segments, and rays.
```
       C
       |
       |
A------B------D
```

**Solution:**
- $\overleftrightarrow{ABD}$ is a line (extends infinitely in both directions)
- $\overline{AB}$ is a line segment (has endpoints A and B)
- $\overline{BD}$ is a line segment (has endpoints B and D)
- $\overrightarrow{BC}$ is a ray (has endpoint B and extends upward through C)

## Section 2: Angles

### What is an Angle?

An angle is formed when two rays share a common endpoint. The common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays are called the sides of the angle.

> **Teaching Moment:** The word "angle" comes from the Latin word "angulus," meaning "corner." You can think of an angle as the corner formed by two rays meeting at a point. The size of an angle is determined by the amount of rotation needed to move from one ray to the other, not by the length of the rays.

### Types of Angles

1. **Acute Angle**: An angle that measures less than 90 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** "Acute" means "sharp" or "pointed." An acute angle looks sharp, like the letter V.

2. **Right Angle**: An angle that measures exactly 90 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** We often mark right angles with a small square in the corner. Think of the corner of a sheet of paper or the corner of a room—these are typically right angles.

3. **Obtuse Angle**: An angle that measures more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** "Obtuse" means "blunt" or "dull." An obtuse angle is wider and less pointed than an acute angle.

4. **Straight Angle**: An angle that measures exactly 180 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** A straight angle forms a straight line. If you stand facing north and then turn to face south, you've rotated through a straight angle.

5. **Reflex Angle**: An angle that measures more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** Reflex angles are the "outside" angles. If you look at the smaller angle formed by two rays, the reflex angle is the larger angle that goes the other way around.

6. **Full Angle**: An angle that measures exactly 360 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** A full angle represents a complete rotation, like turning in a complete circle to face the same direction you started in.

### Problem-Solving Approach: Identifying and Measuring Angles

When working with angles, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the vertex and sides**: The vertex is the point where the two rays meet, and the sides are the rays themselves.
2. **Determine the type of angle**: Based on the measure, classify the angle as acute, right, obtuse, straight, reflex, or full.
3. **Use a protractor if needed**: Place the center of the protractor on the vertex and align the 0-degree mark with one side of the angle. Read the measure where the other side intersects the protractor.

**Example Problem:** 
Classify the following angles:
a) 45°
b) 90°
c) 120°
d) 180°
e) 270°

**Solution:**
a) 45° is an acute angle (less than 90°)
b) 90° is a right angle (exactly 90°)
c) 120° is an obtuse angle (between 90° and 180°)
d) 180° is a straight angle (exactly 180°)
e) 270° is a reflex angle (between 180° and 360°)

### Angle Relationships

1. **Complementary Angles**: Two angles whose sum is 90 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** Think of complementary angles as "completing" each other to form a right angle. For example, 30° and 60° are complementary because 30° + 60° = 90°.

2. **Supplementary Angles**: Two angles whose sum is 180 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** Supplementary angles "supplement" each other to form a straight angle. For example, 110° and 70° are supplementary because 110° + 70° = 180°.

3. **Vertical Angles**: Opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines. Vertical angles are equal.
   > **Teaching Moment:** When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. These angles are always equal, which is a fundamental principle in geometry. This equality occurs because the angles in each pair are on opposite sides of the intersection point.

4. **Adjacent Angles**: Angles that share a common vertex and a common side.
   > **Teaching Moment:** Adjacent angles are "next to" each other. They share a vertex and one side, but they don't overlap. When two lines intersect, they form four angles at the intersection point, and any two neighboring angles are adjacent.

### Problem-Solving Approach: Working with Angle Relationships

When solving problems involving angle relationships, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship**: Determine if the angles are complementary, supplementary, vertical, or adjacent.
2. **Apply the appropriate equation**:
   - Complementary angles: a + b = 90°
   - Supplementary angles: a + b = 180°
   - Vertical angles: a = c and b = d (where a, b, c, d are angles formed by intersecting lines)
3. **Solve for the unknown angle(s)**.

**Example Problem:** 
If two angles are supplementary and one of them is 65°, what is the measure of the other angle?

**Solution:**
Since the angles are supplementary, their sum is 180°.
Let x be the unknown angle.
65° + x = 180°
x = 180° - 65°
x = 115°

Therefore, the other angle measures 115°.

## Section 3: Polygons

### What is a Polygon?

A polygon is a closed figure made up of line segments. The line segments are called the sides of the polygon, and the points where the sides meet are called the vertices.

> **Teaching Moment:** The word "polygon" comes from Greek, where "poly" means "many" and "gon" means "angle." So, a polygon is literally a shape with many angles. Every polygon has the same number of sides as angles.

### Properties of Polygons

1. **Number of Sides**: A polygon is named based on the number of sides it has.
   > **Teaching Moment:** The names of polygons come from Greek prefixes indicating the number of sides, followed by "-gon." For example, "tri-" means three, so a triangle is a three-sided polygon.

2. **Sum of Interior Angles**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is (n-2) × 180 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** This formula can be derived by dividing the polygon into triangles. From any vertex, draw lines to all non-adjacent vertices. This creates (n-2) triangles. Since each triangle has 180°, the sum of all interior angles is (n-2) × 180°.

3. **Sum of Exterior Angles**: The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always 360 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** Imagine walking around the perimeter of a polygon, making a turn at each vertex. By the time you return to your starting point, you've made a complete 360° rotation. This is true for any polygon, regardless of the number of sides!

### Problem-Solving Approach: Finding Polygon Angles

When solving problems involving polygon angles, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the type of polygon**: Determine the number of sides.
2. **Apply the appropriate formula**:
   - Sum of interior angles: (n-2) × 180°
   - Sum of exterior angles: 360°
3. **For regular polygons**, divide the sum of interior angles by the number of sides to find each interior angle.
4. **For exterior angles**, remember that an exterior angle and its adjacent interior angle are supplementary (sum to 180°).

**Example Problem:** 
Find the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon. If the hexagon is regular, what is the measure of each interior angle?

**Solution:**
A hexagon has 6 sides.
Sum of interior angles = (n-2) × 180° = (6-2) × 180° = 4 × 180° = 720°

If the hexagon is regular, all interior angles are equal.
Each interior angle = 720° ÷ 6 = 120°

### Types of Polygons

1. **Triangle**: A polygon with 3 sides.
2. **Quadrilateral**: A polygon with 4 sides.
3. **Pentagon**: A polygon with 5 sides.
4. **Hexagon**: A polygon with 6 sides.
5. **Heptagon**: A polygon with 7 sides.
6. **Octagon**: A polygon with 8 sides.
7. **Nonagon**: A polygon with 9 sides.
8. **Decagon**: A polygon with 10 sides.

> **Teaching Moment:** Many everyday objects are shaped like polygons. Stop signs are octagons, most rooms are quadrilaterals, and many sports fields are rectangles. Recognizing these shapes in the world around you helps reinforce geometric concepts.

### Special Polygons

1. **Regular Polygon**: A polygon with all sides and all angles equal.
   > **Teaching Moment:** Regular polygons have perfect symmetry. Every regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle, with all vertices touching the circle.

2. **Irregular Polygon**: A polygon with unequal sides or angles.
   > **Teaching Moment:** Most polygons in nature and human-made structures are irregular. Even a slightly imperfect square is technically an irregular quadrilateral.

3. **Convex Polygon**: A polygon where all interior angles are less than 180 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** In a convex polygon, any line segment connecting two points inside the polygon stays entirely inside the polygon. Think of it as a polygon that "bulges outward" at every vertex.

4. **Concave Polygon**: A polygon where at least one interior angle is greater than 180 degrees.
   > **Teaching Moment:** A concave polygon has at least one "dent" or "cave-in." If you draw a line segment between any two points inside the polygon, that line might go outside the polygon at some point.

### Problem-Solving Approach: Classifying Polygons

When classifying polygons, follow these steps:

1. **Count the sides**: Determine if it's a triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, etc.
2. **Check for regularity**: Measure the sides and angles to see if they're all equal.
3. **Test for convexity**: Check if any interior angle is greater than 180°. If yes, it's concave; if no, it's convex.

**Example Problem:** 
Classify the following polygon based on its number of sides, regularity, and convexity:
A pentagon with all sides equal but one interior angle of 200°.

**Solution:**
- It's a pentagon because it has 5 sides.
- It's irregular because, although all sides are equal, not all angles are equal (one is 200°).
- It's concave because it has an interior angle greater than 180° (200°).

## Practice Problems

1. Identify the type of angle: 45 degrees.
   > **Problem-Solving Guidance**: Compare the angle measure to the benchmark values (90°, 180°, etc.) to determine its classification.

2. If two angles are complementary and one of them is 35 degrees, what is the measure of the other angle?
   > **Problem-Solving Guidance**: Use the complementary angles formula: a + b = 90°. Substitute the known value and solve for the unknown.

3. Calculate the sum of interior angles of a hexagon.
   > **Problem-Solving Guidance**: Apply the formula for the sum of interior angles: (n-2) × 180°, where n is the number of sides.

4. Identify whether a square is a regular polygon or an irregular polygon.
   > **Problem-Solving Guidance**: Check the definition of a regular polygon (all sides and all angles equal) and determine if a square meets these criteria.

5. If a polygon has 7 sides, how many diagonals does it have?
   > **Problem-Solving Guidance**: Use the formula for the number of diagonals: n(n-3)/2, where n is the number of sides. This formula works because from each vertex, you can draw diagonals to all other vertices except the adjacent ones and itself.
