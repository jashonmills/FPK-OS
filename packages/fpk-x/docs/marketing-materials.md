## Value Proposition by Audience

### For Parents
**Problem**: "You're tracking behaviors on paper, in notes apps, across multiple spreadsheets. You know there are patterns, but you can't see them."

**Solution**: "MyCNS centralizes everything - logs, documents, goals - and uses AI to surface the patterns you're missing. Before your next IEP meeting, ask the AI to summarize 3 months of progress. Done."

**Outcome**: "Data-backed confidence in every decision, meeting, and conversation about your child's care."

### For Educators & Therapists
**Problem**: "You're documenting the same student across multiple systems, duplicating work, and losing valuable insights because data is siloed."

**Solution**: "Log once in MyCNS. Link to IEP goals. Track prompting levels. The platform auto-generates progress charts and correlates your session data with home behaviors."

**Outcome**: "Cut documentation time in half. Show measurable progress. Collaborate seamlessly with families."

### For School Administrators
**Problem**: "Compliance is a nightmare. Service minutes, goal progress, data collection - it's all manual and error-prone."

**Solution**: "MyCNS auto-tracks service delivery, monitors goal progress in real-time, and flags compliance gaps before they become audit issues."

**Outcome**: "IDEA compliance without the administrative burden."

## Feature-Benefit Matrix

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Multi-Source Logging** | Capture incidents, daily life, educator sessions, and sleep in specialized forms | Different data needs different structures - one-size-fits-all logging misses critical details |
| **ABC Analysis** | Document Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence with structured fields | Identify function of behavior to create effective interventions, not just react to symptoms |
| **Document Intelligence** | Upload IEPs/evaluations, auto-extract goals and accommodations | Stop manually re-typing IEP goals. Let AI read your 47-page eval and pull out what matters |
| **AI Assistant (RAG)** | Ask questions, get answers based on YOUR data + clinical research | "What triggers meltdowns?" answered with your child's actual patterns, not generic advice |
| **14 Analytics Charts** | Visualize trends in behavior, sleep, mood, interventions, goal progress | See the pattern: poor sleep → behavior spike. Adjust bedtime, reduce incidents |
| **Team Collaboration** | Invite educators, therapists, grandparents with role-based permissions | Everyone sees the same data. No more "he does that at home?" surprise moments |
| **Goal Tracking** | Auto-import from IEPs, link logs to goals, track progress over time | Know if you're on track to meet IEP goals BEFORE the annual review, not during |
| **Credit-Based AI** | Pay for what you use, not unlimited at a high fixed cost | Families use AI when they need it. We don't charge pro-level prices for basic tracking |
| **Voice-to-Text** | Speak your log entries instead of typing | Right after a meltdown, you can talk through what happened while it's fresh |
| **Intervention Tracking** | Document what strategies you used and rate effectiveness | Stop guessing what works. SEE what works, backed by your own data |
