# patches/eslint-batch-a-b.patch

This repository patch package contains the Batch A (supabase) mechanical fixes and the Batch B autofix artifacts produced in-session.

Important: The environment used to produce these fixes did not have a working `git` binary available, so I could not reliably generate a true git-formatted unified diff. To keep this deliverable fully deterministic and easily appliable on your machine, I produced:

- a directory with the post-fix files: patches/eslint-batch-a-b/files/... (these are the edited files that should replace the ones in your repo)
- a PowerShell apply script: patches/eslint-batch-a-b/apply-patch.ps1 that will back up current files (to patches/eslint-batch-a-b/backups/) and copy the patched files into their correct locations
- a compact report: patches/eslint-batch-a-b/report.md describing commands run, before/after counts, and files touched

How to apply (recommended):
1) Review the files under patches/eslint-batch-a-b/files and the report at patches/eslint-batch-a-b/report.md
2) From the repository root run in PowerShell (Windows):
   .\patches\eslint-batch-a-b\apply-patch.ps1

This script will:
- create a backup folder patches/eslint-batch-a-b/backups/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
- copy the current repository files that will be replaced into that backup folder
- copy the patched files into the repository, overwriting in-place

If you'd still prefer a git-style patch, run this locally (where git is available) after reviewing the packaged files:
- Create a branch, copy the patched files into the repo, git add and commit them, then generate a git-format patch with `git format-patch` or `git diff --no-index` as desired.

Files included in this package:
- supabase/functions/ai-study-chat/index.ts
- supabase/functions/fetch-linear-equations-content/index.ts
- supabase/functions/native-content-proxy/index.ts
- supabase/functions/scorm-parser-advanced/index.ts

Notes:
- Supabase edge functions are Deno-style code (Deno.env, remote imports). Running TypeScript checks or ESLint under Node may show environment-specific diagnostics; these do not imply runtime errors in Deno.
- I intentionally skipped mass-converting or aggressive typing changes (no behavioral changes).

Generated by GitHub Copilot (automated agent) during an in-repo lint/autofix pass. See report.md for full command history and ESLint JSON paths.
